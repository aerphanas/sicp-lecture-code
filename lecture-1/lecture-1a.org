** Declarative Knowledge "What is True"

√x is the y such that y² = x and y ≥ 0

** Imperative Knowledge "How to"

to find an approximation to √x
- make a guess g
- improve the guess by averaging g and x/g
- keep improving the guess until it is good enough
- use 1 as an initial guess

to finding a fixed point of a function f
(that is, a value y such taht f(y) = y)
- start with a guess for y
- eep appliying f over and over until the result doesn't change very much
